            If you left click a button with a mine, you lose and the game is over. If you left click a button that is adjacent (including diagonally) to at least one mine, 
            the button is replaced with a label that indicates the number of adjacent buttons that have mines.If the square is not adjacent to any mines, the button is replaced 
            by a blank label and all of the adjacent buttons that have not already been clicked are automatically pressed since it is safe to do so. A player may mark a button as 
            being a mine by shift left clicking on the button. The button's appearance should visually change to indicate that it has been so marked. A subsequent shift left click 
            clears the mark (i.e., like a toggle). A marked button should not do anything if left-clicked, thus preventing an accidental clicking of a space known to contain a mine.
            The game ends when a player clears (i.e., left-clicks) all of the spaces that do not contain mines and marks all of the spaces with mines.
